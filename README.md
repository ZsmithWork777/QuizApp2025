## 🎯 Learning Focus
The core purpose of this project was to practice **array iteration techniques** within a real-world React application.  

### Technical Goals:
- Use **array loops** (`map`, indexed access) to:
  - Render quiz questions dynamically from a dataset  
  - Display multiple-choice options without hardcoding  
  - Track the current index and move through the array with **Next** button logic  
- Apply **React state management** (`useState`, `useRef`) to control:
  - Current question index  
  - Selected answers  
  - Score calculation  
  - Reset and replay functionality  

### Why this matters:
- In real-world apps, data (like questions, products, or API responses) almost always comes in **arrays**.  
- Learning how to **loop through arrays in React** and render components conditionally is a foundational skill.  
- This project demonstrates how raw array data can be transformed into an **interactive UI**.
